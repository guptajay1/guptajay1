### Hi there 👋, My name is Ajay Gupta

#### Lead MLOps Engineer with nearly 6 years of experience specializing in bridging the gap between Machine Learning and Operations. My expertise lies in designing, building, and deploying robust, scalable, and automated end-to-end ML systems on the cloud.

#### I have a proven track record of optimizing the entire ML lifecycle—from data processing and experiment tracking to model deployment and monitoring. I thrive on architecting resilient cloud infrastructure and automating CI/CD pipelines to accelerate delivery and enhance system reliability.

#### Key areas of expertise include:
- ML Workflow Orchestration: Designing and implementing production-grade ML pipelines using AWS SageMaker, Kubeflow, MLflow, and Databricks.
- Cloud & DevOps Automation: Building and managing infrastructure as code (IaC) with Terraform and automating CI/CD processes in Azure DevOps and Jenkins.
- Cloud Architecture: Deep proficiency in AWS and Azure, including leading a successful on-premise to AWS cloud migration utilizing services like EC2, S3, Lambda, EKS, and VPC.
- System Design: Strong foundation in distributed systems, microservices architecture, and API development.

#### I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and build efficient, scalable systems. Let's connect to discuss innovations in MLOps and cloud engineering.

#### Core Technologies:
 - **MLOps/Data:** `AWS SageMaker`, `MLflow`, `Kubeflow`, `Databricks`, `PySpark`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`
 - **Cloud/DevOps:** `AWS`, `Azure`, `GCP`, `Kubernetes (EKS)`, `Docker`, `Ansible`, `Jenkins`, `CI/CD`
